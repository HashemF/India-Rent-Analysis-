    "1. Data Description and Analysis\n",
    "We will be taking a look at a dataset with 4700+ houses with several columns detailing the numbers and existance of bedrooms, floors, and finalizing with the rental price.\n",
    " *Note: keep in mind the data is mainly for india, and that it includes the district the home is in, as well as whether the home is a apartment, house, or other form of living.\n",
    " \n",
    " My motivation to select this dataset was from the usage of this data fullfilling not only the objectives required to construct a model, but also is a great datatset to practice model building and creating a machine dedicated to possibly predict the price of housing based on the factors determined in a house. India is a vast and fluctuating city with alot of information available to those outside of the country, which is why their data will be a great foundation to understanding prices within the city should someone consider living there. While a price will definitely be more if the size is much greater than one other, would one price differ in Mumbai compared to Lucklow with the exact same features? that's what we will try to find out\n",
    " \n",
    " My Objective with this dataset is to create a model estimating rent based on the factors needed by the individual for their living space. For example, if a person wants a house with a garage, 2 bedrooms, a bath, and of small size, I would like to input the data into the model and come out with a price such as 8000. we will construct several models using different factors and ultimately decide on one\n",
    " \n",
    " Our approach to completing this area will be to first determine the factors that are important to the dataset, using testing and visualization. Next we will predict and train our data to detect any source of underfitting, overfitting, or more.\n",
